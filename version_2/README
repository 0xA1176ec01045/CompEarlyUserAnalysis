This folder contains csv output from the version of these scripts
reported to the Compound forum on June 17, 2021.

Early user feedback helped me identify an issue with tracking of
cToken transfers in the accrued interest calculations.

These results are therefore inaccurate for users who sent or
received cTokens, including transfers associated with a liquidation
or interactions with certain contracts (e.g. smart wallets).
These lists should be considered inaccurate and are kept here
strictly for historical reference if needed.
