# CompEarlyUserAnalysis

Uses Python web3 module and Compound application binary interfaces (ABIs) to identify addresses that interacted in specified ways with the Compound protocol prior to the introduction of the COMP token.

The Compound community is considering the merits of a retroactive airdrop to early users. The active discussion can be found on the [Compound forum](https://www.comp.xyz/t/should-compound-retroactively-airdrop-tokens-to-early-users/595).

This tool is a work in progress by a small-fry early Compound user who uses Python for scientific computing but is not a professional Solidity or web3 developer. Please be kind, constructive criticism, suggestions, and pull requests are all welcome!
